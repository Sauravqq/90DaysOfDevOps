### What is Kernel

The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer’s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.

### What is Shell

A shell is a unique user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services. Shell accepts human-readable commands from a user and converts them into something the kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.

### What is Linux Shell Scripting?

A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Linux shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

A DevOps Engineer uses Shell Script to automate processes that are manual such as taking backups, sending the same type of mail to multiple users, and many more tasks involving folder/file creation or deletion and it goes further as per the requirement.

### What is `#!/bin/bash?`

**#!/bin/bash** is a shebang line used in script files to set bash, present in the ‘/bin’ directory, as the default shell for executing commands present in the file. “#!” is a **shebang** in the character sequence consisting of the character’s number sign and exclamation mark ( #!) at the beginning of a script. We must specify this at the beginning of any shell script to let the script know, under which shell it’s being run.

Just like every Movie has a production house at the start, similarly #! is the production house of Shell Scripting.
